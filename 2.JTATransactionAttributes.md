##	Six Transaction attributes


###	1.Required:
	
-	 If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method
	-	 the method executes within the client's transaction
-	 If the client is not associated with a transaction
	-	 the container starts a new transaction before running the method
-	Most container-managed transactions use Required		

###	2.	RequiresNew: 

-	If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method,
	-	the container suspends the client's transaction, starts a new transaction, delegates the call to the method, 
-	And finally resumes the client's transaction after the method completes. 
-	If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container starts a new transaction before running the method


###	Mandatory:

-	If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method, the method executes within the client's transaction
-	If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container throws the TransactionRequiredException.
-	Use the Mandatory attribute if the enterprise bean's method must use the transaction of the client


###	NotSupported:

-	 If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method
	-	the container suspends the client's transaction before invoking the method
-	After the method has completed, the container resumes the client's transaction
-	If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container does not start a new transaction before running the method
- 	Use the NotSupported attribute for methods that don't need transactions


###	Supports:

-	 If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method, 
	-	the method executes within the client's transaction
-	If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container does not start a new transaction before running the method
-	Because the transactional behavior of the method may vary, we should use the Supports attribute with caution


###	Never:

-	If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method, the container throws a RemoteException
-	If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container does not start a new transaction before running the method


##	Transaction Rollback

-	There are two ways to roll back a container-managed transaction:
	-	If a system exception is thrown, the container automatically rolls back the transaction
	-	We	can also roll back a transaction by invoking the setRollbackOnly() method of the EJBContext interface
