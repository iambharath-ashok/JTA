# 	Components of Distributed Transactions

-	The components involved in the distributed transaction processing (DTP) model are:

	-	The application
	-	The application server
	-	The transaction manager
	-	The resource adapter
	-	The resource manager
	
	
##	Application to Database Local Transactions

-	In simplest form, relational database access involves:
	-	Application
	-	A resource manager
	-	Resource adapter
	
-	The application is simply the end-user access point to send requests to, and obtain data from, a database	
-	The resource adapter is the communications channel, or request translator, between the application and database
-	resource manager local transaction is one transaction that is confined to a single, specific enterprise database
-	The application sends a request for data to the JDBC driver, which then translates the request and sends it across the network to the database
- 	The database returns the data to the driver, which then translates the result to the application, as illustrated in the following diagram

##	Application Servers with Database Local Transactions


-	The application server is another component of the transaction process that is addressed by the JTA
-	Application servers handle the bulk of application operations and take some of the load off of the end-user application

##	Distributed Transactions and the Transaction Manager

-	A distributed transaction is a transaction that accesses and updates data on two or more networked resources
- 	These resources could consist of several different RDBMSs housed on a single sever, for example, Oracle, SQL Server, and Sybase; or they could include several instances of a single type of database residing on a number of different servers
-	In any case, a distributed transaction involves coordination among the various resource managers
-	This coordination is the function of the transaction manager

-	The transaction manager is responsible for making the final decision either to commit or rollback any distributed transaction
-	 A commit decision should lead to a successful transaction; rollback leaves the data in the database unaltered


-	JTA specifies standard Java interfaces between the transaction manager and the other components in a distributed transaction: 
	-	The application
	-	The application server
	-	The resource managers
	
-	This relationship is illustrated in the following diagram:

###	1—UserTransaction:

-	The javax.transaction.UserTransaction interface provides the application the ability to control transaction boundaries programmatically
-	The javax.transaction.UserTransaction method starts a global transaction and associates the transaction with the calling thread

###	2—Transaction Manager:	

-	The javax.transaction.TransactionManager interface allows the application server to control transaction boundaries on behalf of the application being managed

###	3—XAResource:	

-	The javax.transaction.xa.XAResource interface is a Java mapping of the industry standard XA interface based on the X/Open CAE Specification (Distributed Transaction Processing: The XA Specification).
