#	ACID Properties of Transactions

-	Atomicity: Transaction is an atomic unit of operation that is committed in its entirety or not performed at all.
-	Consistency: In the process of transaction, the consistent state of the data must be preserved from one consistent state to another after complete execution.
-	Isolation: The transaction must be performed in an isolated manner so that any other concurrent transaction must not interfere within the process.
-	Durability: Once the transaction is committed, the changes must persist, and be available for the next set of operations.
