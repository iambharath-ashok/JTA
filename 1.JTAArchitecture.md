# JTA - Java Transaction API

-	A transaction is a series of operations that must be performed atomically
-	Each operation in the series must succeed for the entire transaction to be successful
-	If any operation in the transaction does not succeed, the entire transaction fails
-	At that point, any operations which have succeeded must be "rolled back" so that the end state matches what was in place before the transaction started


## RealTime example of Transaction

-	Let's assume we want to transfer $50 from a savings account (account number: 12345-1) to a checking account (account number 12345-2).
- 	The steps in this transaction can be stated in "pseudo code" as follows:

		   BOUNDARY: START TRANSACTION A
		   SUBTRACT 50 DOLLARS FROM SAVINGS ACCOUNT 12345-1
		   ADD 50 DOLLARS TO THE CHECKING ACCOUNT 12345-2
		   BOUNDARY: END TRANSACTION A

-	To run the transaction, the following code is required

			 PREPARE (RUN) TRANSACTION A
			 IF TRANSACTION A SUCCEEDED
				   COMMIT TRANSACTION A
			 ELSE
				   ROLLBACK TRANSACTION A

-	Failure Scenario:
				   
	-	Let's assume that there are sufficient funds to subtract $50 from the savings account, so the first part of the transaction succeeds.
	- 	However, let's also assume that the second part fails. When the computer attempts to add 50 dollars to the checking account, it discovers that the checking account is frozen. 
	-	Because the second part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails.
	-	As a result, the first part of the transaction needs to be rolled back: $50 needs to be placed back into the savings account 12345-1. 
	-	This is essential. Otherwise, each time the computer tries to transfer money from the savings to the checking account, it will lose the money!


-	Success Scenario:

	-	If the entire transaction succeeds, then the entire transaction is committed, and the results are made permanent
	
## Two Phase Commit

-	In the above transactions the commit process takes two phases to complete.
-	In the first phase, checks are made to see that the transaction ran without error.
-	If there were no errors, the results are committed in the second phase.
-	If there were errors in the first-phase check, the transaction is rolled back.
- 	This common transaction strategy is appropriately called the two-phase commit protocol.


##	Transactions in the J2EE Environment

-	There are typically three participants in a transaction:

	-	An application that initiates the request for the transaction
	-	A data store (such as a database) that the transaction runs against
	-	And an API (such as a driver) that communicates between the application and the data store
	
	
	
##	Transactions in J2EE platform

-	JTA API gives us the ability to perform distributed transactions
	-	That is, an application can use the API to perform transactions on more than one data store in the network at the same time	
-	But to do this efficiently, it needs to have another component operating in the application server: a J2EE transaction manager
	
##	Transaction Manager

-	A transaction manager helps to efficiently schedule and execute the potentially large number of transactions coming in through the application server
-	Many database vendors have their own transaction managers
-	A particular DBMS's transaction manager might not work with databases from different vendors
-	The JTA specification states that "A JTA transaction is controlled by the J2EE transaction manager
-	J2EE transaction manager does have one limitation: the J2EE transaction model is flat
-	Support for nested transactions is not part of J2EE
-	This means that the J2EE transaction manager cannot start a transaction for an instance until the previous transaction has ended


##	Interfaces to perform JTA Transactions

-	Each interfaces uses a unique approach to handling transactions. The interfaces are:

	-	javax.transaction.UserTransaction
		-	This interface allows you to specify the transaction boundaries, bypassing a transaction manager
		
	-	javax.transaction.TransactionManager
		-	 This interface allows you to delegate the boundaries of the transactions,
			-	As well as various transaction operations, to the J2EE transaction manager
		
	-	javax.transaction.xa.XAResource
		-	 This interface maps to the X/Open CAE Specification (Distributed Transaction Processing: The XA Specification) standard for using third-party XA-compliant transaction managers to perform transactions


##	Six transaction attributes


###	1.Required:
	
	-	 If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method
		-	 the method executes within the client's transaction
	-	 If the client is not associated with a transaction
		-	 the container starts a new transaction before running the method
	-	Most container-managed transactions use Required		

###	2.	RequiresNew: 

-	If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method,
	-	the container suspends the client's transaction, starts a new transaction, delegates the call to the method, 
-	And finally resumes the client's transaction after the method completes. 
-	If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container starts a new transaction before running the method


###	Mandatory:

-	If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method, the method executes within the client's transaction
-	If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container throws the TransactionRequiredException.
-	Use the Mandatory attribute if the enterprise bean's method must use the transaction of the client


###	NotSupported:

-	 If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method
	-	the container suspends the client's transaction before invoking the method
-	After the method has completed, the container resumes the client's transaction
-	If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container does not start a new transaction before running the method
- 	Use the NotSupported attribute for methods that don't need transactions


###	Supports:

-	 If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method, 
	-	the method executes within the client's transaction
-	If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container does not start a new transaction before running the method
-	Because the transactional behavior of the method may vary, we should use the Supports attribute with caution


###	Never:

-	If the client is running within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method, the container throws a RemoteException
-	If the client is not associated with a transaction, the container does not start a new transaction before running the method




##	Transaction Rollback

-	There are two ways to roll back a container-managed transaction:
	-	If a system exception is thrown, the container automatically rolls back the transaction
	-	We	can also roll back a transaction by invoking the setRollbackOnly() method of the EJBContext interface
