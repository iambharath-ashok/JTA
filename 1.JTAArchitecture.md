# JTA - Java Transaction API

-	A transaction is a series of operations that must be performed atomically
-	Each operation in the series must succeed for the entire transaction to be successful
-	If any operation in the transaction does not succeed, the entire transaction fails
-	At that point, any operations which have succeeded must be "rolled back" so that the end state matches what was in place before the transaction started


## RealTime example of Transaction

-	Let's assume we want to transfer $50 from a savings account (account number: 12345-1) to a checking account (account number 12345-2).
- 	The steps in this transaction can be stated in "pseudo code" as follows:

		   BOUNDARY: START TRANSACTION A
		   SUBTRACT 50 DOLLARS FROM SAVINGS ACCOUNT 12345-1
		   ADD 50 DOLLARS TO THE CHECKING ACCOUNT 12345-2
		   BOUNDARY: END TRANSACTION A

-	To run the transaction, the following code is required

			 PREPARE (RUN) TRANSACTION A
			 IF TRANSACTION A SUCCEEDED
				   COMMIT TRANSACTION A
			 ELSE
				   ROLLBACK TRANSACTION A

-	Failure Scenario:
				   
	-	Let's assume that there are sufficient funds to subtract $50 from the savings account, so the first part of the transaction succeeds.
	- 	However, let's also assume that the second part fails. When the computer attempts to add 50 dollars to the checking account, it discovers that the checking account is frozen. 
	-	Because the second part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails.
	-	As a result, the first part of the transaction needs to be rolled back: $50 needs to be placed back into the savings account 12345-1. 
	-	This is essential. Otherwise, each time the computer tries to transfer money from the savings to the checking account, it will lose the money!


-	Success Scenario:

	-	If the entire transaction succeeds, then the entire transaction is committed, and the results are made permanent
	
## Two Phase Commit

-	In the above transactions the commit process takes two phases to complete.
-	In the first phase, checks are made to see that the transaction ran without error.
-	If there were no errors, the results are committed in the second phase.
-	If there were errors in the first-phase check, the transaction is rolled back.
- 	This common transaction strategy is appropriately called the two-phase commit protocol.
